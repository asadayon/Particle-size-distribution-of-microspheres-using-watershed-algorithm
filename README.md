# Particle-size-distribution-of-microspheres-using-watershed-algorithm
This describes my works on the published paper "Development of a porous layer-by-layer microsphere with branched aliphatic hydrocarbon porogens", where I analyzed the particle and pore size distributions of microspheres.
Analyzed and interpreted particle size distribution and porosity (pore size and density) measurements on microspheres SEM images using python libraries (cv2, skimage, scipy, matplotlib) and MATLAB.
