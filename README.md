# Particle-size-distribution-of-microspheres-using-watershed-algorithm
This describes my work on the published paper "Development of a porous layer-by-layer microsphere with branched aliphatic hydrocarbon porogens", where I analyzed microspheres' particle and pore size distributions.

I analyzed and interpreted particle size distribution and porosity (pore size and density) measurements on microspheres SEM images using python libraries (cv2, skimage, scipy, matplotlib) and MATLAB.
